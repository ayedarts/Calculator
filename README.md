# Calculator
A JavaFX graphical calculator

This project had the pedagogical aim of a first contact with JavaFX, as well as another efficient use of Object-Oriented programming.
Every aspect of the caclculator was coded, both backend and frontend, giving a runnable java application which behaves as the default Windows calculator.
This was again a school project, so more detail can be found at:
